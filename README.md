# REACT-DND To-Do List

React-DND (Drag and Drop) To-Do list for practice.

The source code was from [Leo Chiu's Medium article](https://medium.com/%E6%89%8B%E5%AF%AB%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98/react-dnd-implement-task-board-16ce7f67289c) with a little bit change of the usage of `useDrop`. Because the react-dnd in the article is v9.4, which needs to be modified after upgrading to the lastest version v16.0.1.
